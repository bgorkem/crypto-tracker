# Task Audit Report: Missing UI Components

**Date**: 2025-01-05  
**Triggered By**: User request to verify Task T082 definition  
**Impact**: 4 new tasks added (T089-T092), total tasks increased from 88 to 92

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive requirements audit revealed that **4 critical UI component tasks were missing** from the original task list. These tasks are essential for fulfilling 9 functional requirements (FR-009, FR-011, FR-012, FR-013, FR-015, FR-016, FR-023, FR-024, FR-025).

**Action Taken**: Added T089-T092 to tasks.md, updated progress.md and plan.md

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Misunderstanding
- **Session Handoff Document** (SESSION-HANDOFF-T082.md) described T082 as "Price Ticker Component"
- **Official Task Definition** (tasks.md line 1276) defines T082 as "Loading states and skeleton loaders"
- **Conflict**: Two different scopes for the same task number

### Discovery
While verifying T082, a full requirements coverage analysis revealed:
- Backend APIs for prices (T069-T071) and charts (T072-T073) were implemented
- **NO corresponding UI component tasks existed** to display this data
- plan.md mentioned components like `PriceTickerPanel.tsx` and `PortfolioValueChart.tsx` but no implementation tasks

## Constitutional Compliance

All new tasks (T089-T092) comply with the constitution:

### Code Quality (Article I)
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (each component has one purpose)
- ✅ Strict TypeScript typing enforced
- ✅ File length ≤400 lines (estimated ~150-200 lines each)
- ✅ Clear layer boundaries (UI → API → Data)

### Test-First Quality (Article II)
- ✅ E2E test T034 already exists for real-time updates
- ✅ Contract tests for APIs already passing (T020, T021)
- ✅ Integration tests for price/chart data complete

### User Experience (Article III)
- ✅ ShadCN UI components (Badge, Skeleton, etc.)
- ✅ Tailwind 4 design tokens
- ✅ Loading states specified
- ✅ Accessibility requirements (keyboard nav, ARIA)

### Performance (Article IV)
- ✅ NFR-003: ≤250ms price updates (React Query 30s staleTime)
- ✅ NFR-009: ≤500ms chart rendering
- ✅ NFR-001: ≤2s dashboard load
- ✅ Indexed queries, client-side caching

## Lessons Learned

1. **Session handoff documents should reference official task IDs** - Avoid creating alternate task descriptions that conflict with tasks.md
2. **Requirements audits should be mandatory before marking phases complete** - Prevented shipping MVP with missing features
3. **UI component tasks should be created alongside API tasks** - Don't assume "implementation" covers frontend
4. **plan.md component structure should map 1:1 with tasks.md** - If plan.md mentions a component, tasks.md must have a task for it

---

## Verification

**Checklist for Reviewers**:
- [ ] All 4 new tasks (T089-T092) added to tasks.md
