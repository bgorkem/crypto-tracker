# üî• HOTFIX: User Profile Creation Issue

## Problem
Users can register but cannot create portfolios. Error:
```
insert or update on table "portfolios" violates foreign key constraint "portfolios_user_id_fkey"
Key is not present in table "user_profiles".
```

## Root Cause
When users register via Supabase Auth, they're added to `auth.users` but NOT to `user_profiles` table. The portfolios table requires a matching record in `user_profiles`.

## Solution
Create a database trigger that automatically creates `user_profiles` records when users sign up.

## üö® IMMEDIATE FIX (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Apply SQL Patch

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/hypcnmhuemqtlsxmfzbc/sql/new

2. Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- 1. Create the trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (id, email, created_at, updated_at)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    NOW(),
    NOW()
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- 2. Create the trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();

-- 3. Fix existing users (create missing user_profiles)
INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (id, email, created_at, updated_at)
SELECT 
  au.id,
  au.email,
  au.created_at,
  au.updated_at
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.user_profiles up ON au.id = up.id
WHERE up.id IS NULL;

-- 4. Verify it worked
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_auth_users,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.user_profiles) as total_user_profiles
FROM auth.users;
```

3. Click **"Run"**

4. Verify the last query shows matching counts:
   - `total_auth_users` = `total_user_profiles` ‚úÖ

### Step 2: Test

1. Try creating a portfolio with your existing user
2. Should work now! ‚úÖ

---

## üìã What This Does

1. **Creates a trigger function** (`handle_new_user`)
   - Automatically runs when a new user signs up
   - Creates matching `user_profiles` record

2. **Creates the trigger** (`on_auth_user_created`)
   - Fires AFTER INSERT on `auth.users`
   - Calls `handle_new_user()` function

3. **Fixes existing users**
   - Finds users in `auth.users` without `user_profiles` records
   - Creates missing records
   - Your current user should now work!

4. **Verifies the fix**
   - Counts should match
   - All future signups will work automatically

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

After applying the fix:

1. **Test existing user**:
   - Login with your registered user
   - Try to create a portfolio
   - Should work! ‚úÖ

2. **Test new user**:
   - Register a new account
   - Confirm email
   - Login
   - Create portfolio
   - Should work! ‚úÖ

## üîç Why This Happened

The initial migration (`20240101000000_initial_schema.sql`) created the `user_profiles` table but didn't include a trigger to populate it automatically during signup. This is a common issue when:

1. Database schema is created manually
2. Supabase Auth is added later
3. Missing the auth ‚Üí profile sync trigger

This hotfix adds the missing trigger that should have been in the initial setup.

---

## üìù Long-term Fix

The migration file has been added to the repository:
- `supabase/migrations/20250107000000_auto_create_user_profile.sql`

For future deployments or new projects, this migration will be included automatically.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Apply to production first** (you just did this)
2. **Commit the migration** to git (done)
3. **All future users** will have profiles created automatically
4. **Existing users** are now fixed

---

## üéØ Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check all users have profiles
SELECT 
  au.email,
  CASE WHEN up.id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Has Profile ‚úÖ' ELSE 'Missing Profile ‚ùå' END as status
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.user_profiles up ON au.id = up.id
ORDER BY au.created_at DESC;

-- Should show ‚úÖ for all users
```

```sql
-- Check trigger exists
SELECT 
  trigger_name,
  event_manipulation,
  event_object_table,
  action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';

-- Should return one row
```

---

## üöÄ Status: FIXED

After applying the SQL above:
- ‚úÖ Existing users can create portfolios
- ‚úÖ New users will automatically get profiles
- ‚úÖ No code changes needed
- ‚úÖ Production is now stable
