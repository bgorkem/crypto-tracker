# Feature Specification: Crypto Portfolio Tracker MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-MVP-features`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Users can register (social login or email/password), create portfolios with initial positions, record/edit/delete buy/sell transactions, track value progress with realtime price updates from an external crypto price provider, automatic holding calculations, view 30+ major cryptocurrency prices, last 24hr changes, and portfolio value via charts in a dashboard.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
Template steps conceptually satisfied by drafting below. Ambiguities explicitly marked.
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: Which social authentication providers should be supported for user registration? ‚Üí A: Google only
- Q: How long after creation should users be allowed to edit transactions? ‚Üí A: Unrestricted (edit anytime)
- Q: At what transaction count should the system start using pagination or lazy loading? ‚Üí A: 100 transactions
- Q: What should the default set of time intervals be for portfolio value charts? ‚Üí A: 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, All time
- Q: When should the system consider price data "stale" and display a warning? ‚Üí A: 30 seconds

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A new user signs up, creates a portfolio, adds initial BUY transactions for several assets, and immediately sees a dashboard with current prices, holdings quantities, cost basis, allocation percentages, 24h performance, and a value-over-time chart that updates as live price data arrives.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an unregistered visitor, **When** they register via email/password, **Then** their account is created and an empty dashboard with guidance is shown.
2. **Given** a user with no portfolios, **When** they create a portfolio with an initial set of transactions (bulk entry), **Then** holdings and total value appear within 1s.
3. **Given** a user with existing holdings, **When** they add a BUY transaction, **Then** the holding quantity, cost basis, and total portfolio value recalculate immediately (<1s perceived).
4. **Given** a user with a holding, **When** they submit a SELL exceeding available quantity, **Then** the system rejects it with a clear validation message and no state change.
5. **Given** a dashboard open, **When** new price data arrives, **Then** asset rows and total value update within 250ms of receipt.
6. **Given** a user editing a transaction, **When** they change quantity and save, **Then** the recalculated cost basis and unrealized P/L reflect the change.
7. **Given** a user deletes a transaction, **When** deletion succeeds, **Then** derived holdings and chart data are recalculated and displayed.
8. **Given** a user with multiple portfolios, **When** they switch the active portfolio, **Then** charts, tables, and metrics reflect the new selection with loading feedback.
9. **Given** a price feed outage, **When** the feed is unreachable, **Then** the dashboard shows a stale indicator and last-updated timestamp remains unchanged.

### Edge Cases
- SELL quantity > current holding ‚Üí validation error, no mutation.
- Duplicate simultaneous submissions (double-click) ‚Üí idempotent creation or prevention.
- Out-of-order price updates ‚Üí latest timestamp wins; stale data ignored.
- Transaction timestamp in future ‚Üí reject with explanation.
- Extremely volatile price swing (>20% in 5 min) ‚Üí highlight affected assets (visual indicator) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: highlight requirement?].
- Asset symbol not in supported list ‚Üí reject with guidance to supported symbols list.
- Portfolio with zero holdings ‚Üí show onboarding CTA (add transaction, import, learn). 

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support user registration via email/password and Google OAuth.

- **FR-009**: System MUST fetch price data for ‚â•30 supported symbols at configured interval or streaming feed.
- **FR-010**: System MUST compute total portfolio value = Œ£ (holding quantity √ó latest price) on each price or transaction change.
